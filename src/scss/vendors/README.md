# Vendors

Contains all third party code from external libraries and frameworks, such as

- Normalize
- Bootstrap
- jQueryUI

> If this is required, its good practice to create a new folder called `vendors-extensions/` and then name any files after the vendors they overwrite. The file `vendors-extensions/_bootstrap.scss` would contain all your Bootstrap overrides — as editing the vendor files themselves, isn’t generally a good idea.
